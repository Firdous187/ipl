    <h1>Chennai Super Kings</h1>
    <p>Chennai Super Kings (CSK) is an Indian professional cricket franchise based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The team competes in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and was one of the eight franchises incorporated when the league was established in 2008. The team plays its home matches at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai and is owned by Chennai Super Kings Cricket Limited.

        Super Kings is the joint-most successful IPL franchise having won five IPL titles (shared with Mumbai Indians). In the IPL, they have appeared in a record 10 finals and qualified for the playoff stages 12 times out of the 15 seasons they have played, more than any other team. Super Kings have also won the Champions League Twenty20 twice in 2010 and 2014. The team is currently captained by Ruturaj Gaikwad and coached by Stephen Fleming.
        
        The team was suspended for two years from the IPL starting July 2015 due to the involvement of its owners in the 2013 IPL betting case. Super Kings re-joined IPL for the 2018 season and won the title in its comeback season. The team has a significant fan following. In January 2022, CSK became India's first unicorn sports enterprise. As of 2022, it was the second most valuable IPL franchise with a valuation of $1.15 billion.
        
        History
        Early years (2008â€“09)
        In September 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the establishment of the Indian Premier League (IPL), a Twenty20 competition with the inaugural season to be held in 2008.[1] Chennai was one of the eight city-based franchises unveiled for the inaugaural edition in 2018.[2]

        The first player auctions for the inaugural IPL season was conducted in January 2008. MS Dhoni, who was the captain of the Indian team was bought by the Super Kings for $1.5 million, the most expensive buy at the auction.[3] The franchise bought other international cricketers such as Suresh Raina, Matthew Hayden, Stephen Fleming, Muttiah Muralitharan and Michael Hussey.[4] Ahead of the inaugural season, the franchise named Dhoni as the captain of the team and appointed Kepler Wessels as the head coach.[5] Super Kings played their first game in the IPL on 19 April 2008 against Kings XI Punjab at Mohali, which they won by 33 runs.[6] The Super Kings finished the league stage in third place with eight wins from 14 games.[7] They beat Kings XI Punjab by nine wickets in the semifinal.[8] The Super Kings faced the Rajasthan Royals in the final at Mumbai which they lost by three wickets.[9] By finishing as runners-up, the Super Kings qualified for the inaugural season of the inaugural Champions League Twenty20 (CLT20). The tournament was later cancelled due to the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the Super Kings received $5 million as compensation for the same.[10]
        
        Ahead of the 2009 season, Stephen Fleming took over as the head coach of the Super Kings.[11] At the player auction, Super Kings bought English all-rounder Andrew Flintoff for $1.55 million making him the joint highest-paid IPL cricketer.[12] Hussey decided to skip the IPL season to focus on The Ashes.[13] The Super Kings finished the league stage in second place with 17 points from 14 matches.[14] In the semi-finals, they were beaten by Royal Challengers Bangalore by six wickets.[15] Super Kings opener Matthew Hayden, who scored 572 runs in the tournament, won the Orange Cap for the leading run-scorer of the season.[16]</p>
        <h2>Ruturaj Gaikwad</h2>

        <p>Ruturaj Gaikwad has been unveiled as the new captain of Chennai Super Kings a day before the opening game of IPL 2024, where defending champions CSK take on the visiting Royal Challengers Bengaluru at Chepauk. This brings to an end MS Dhoni's long stint as captain of CSK - which began in the tournament's first season back in 2008 - though he had stepped away from the position in 2022 too, when Ravindra Jadeja was made captain. But Jadeja stepped down after eight matches and Dhoni took back the reins, continuing in 2023 when CSK won the trophy for the fifth time and drew level with Mumbai Indians at the top of the title leaderboard.</p>
